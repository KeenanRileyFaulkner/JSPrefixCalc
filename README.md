# JSPrefixCalc

+, -, *, and / will each take two arguments and return a result. Sqrt will take a single argument. Convert any infix expression to prefix notation, then enter each
operator or operand separated by a space.

Example: (sqrt(25*4)+8)/2 should be entered as "/ + 8 sqrt * 25 4 2" and will evaluate to 9.
