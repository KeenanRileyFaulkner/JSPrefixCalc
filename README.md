# JSPrefixCalc

+, -, *, and / will each take two arguments and return a result. Sqrt will take a single argument. Convert any infix expression to prefix notation, then enter each
operator or operand separated by a space.

Example: (sqrt(25*4)+8)/2 should be entered as "/ + sqrt * 25 4 8 2". 

1. It will first multiply the two numbers after * (25 * 4), 

2. then take the square root of that number (sqrt(100)),

3. then add the two numbers after + (8, 10)

4. then divide the first number after / by the second number after / (18 / 2)

5. and evaluate to 9.
